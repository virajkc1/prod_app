# Cursor Rules for Capto Project

## CRITICAL: Code Generation Policy

**NEVER generate or write code to files unless the user EXPLICITLY requests it.**

### Rules:

1. **DO NOT** create, edit, or modify any code files unless the user explicitly says "write code", "create file", "implement", or similar direct instruction
2. **DO NOT** use tools like `write`, `search_replace`, `edit_file`, etc. unless explicitly instructed
3. **ONLY** provide guidance, explanations, and examples in chat
4. If the user asks for code examples, show them in the chat response ONLY - do NOT add to codebase
5. When in doubt, ask before making any code changes
6. The user is learning - provide explanations and guidance, not implementations

### What TO do:

- Explain concepts
- Provide code examples in chat only
- Guide step-by-step
- Answer questions
- Help debug (by explaining, not fixing)
- Review code when asked

### What NOT to do:

- Write code to files
- Create new files
- Modify existing files
- Run commands that change the codebase
- Assume the user wants code generated

## Project Context

- This is a learning project
- User wants to build it themselves with guidance
- Use agent mode for step-by-step guidance only
- Code examples should be in chat, not in files
